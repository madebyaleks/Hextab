	<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
	<p class="lead">
		The Chrome Web Store developer terms states that we must provide a privacy policy so here it is in all it’s long, complicated legal glory:
	</p>
	<p>
		Made by Aleks (hereafter referred to as <i>we</i>) <b>does not</b> collect nor store any information about the user (hereafter referred to as <i>you</i>) while using Hextab (hereafter referred to as <i>the extension</i>). As of now we honestly don’t need to and can’t really imagine who, besides us, would possibly want to know when you open a new tab in Chrome. We reserve the right to include analytics in the form of page views, time spent on a page and page speed in future releases. This is only because we are curious and to optimise the app. Privacy is important to us and we promise to <b>never ever</b> share personal information with anyone.
	</p>
	<p>
		If we in a future release decide to include analytics we will notify you on the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a> and this page.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are unable to guarantee that third-party services this app includes, <i><a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Fonts</a></i>, does not track or collects information about you. We will do our best to select services with an transparent policy but offers no guarantees whatsoever. 
	</p>
	<p>
		For full control of your online privacy we recommend using services such as <a href="https://www.ghostery.com">Ghostery</a> to discover and block these forms for tracking.
