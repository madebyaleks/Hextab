<p>Ever wondered what colour the time is? Well now you can find out every time you open a new page in Chrome. </p>

<p>This extension replaces your new tab page with a customizable hexclock. It, oviously, tells the time but also the colour by using the 24 hour clock as a hexcode. Pretty neat, right?</p>

<h2 id="howtoinstall">How to install</h2>

<p>There are two ways to add this extension:<br/>
1. Visit the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/">extension page in Chrome Web Store</a>. <em>This is the recomended way</em>.
2. <code>git clone git@github.com:madebyaleks/Hextab.git</code><br/>
Then turn on developer mode in Chrome and load the folder. If you do it this way you&#8217;ll need to update the extension manually.</p>

<p>Probably. The entire project is based on <a href="http://www.jacopocolo.com/">Jacopos</a> hexclock. There are also two or three extensions in the Web Store already. Neither of them can be customized though.</p>
