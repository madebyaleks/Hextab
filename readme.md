# Hextab  
Ever wondered what colour the time is? Well now you can find out every time you open a new tab in Chrome.  

This extension replaces your new tab page with a customizable hexclock. It, obviously, tells the time but also the colour by using the 24 hour clock as a hexcode. Pretty neat, right?

## How to install
There are two ways to add this extension:  
1. Visit the [extension page in Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hextab/empjoamnmbkhiajjchaokocjklffmnlb)  
2. Clone this repository and manually install it in your favourite browser  

## Haven't I seen this before?
Probably. The entire project is based on [Jacopos](http://www.jacopocolo.com/) hexclock. There are also two or three extensions in the Web Store already. Neither of them can be customized though.
