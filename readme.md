# Hextab  
Ever wondered what colour the time is? Well now you can find out every time you open a new page in Chrome.  

This extension replaces your new tab page with a customizable hexclock. It, oviously, tells the time but also the colour by using the 24 hour clock as a hexcode. Pretty neat, right?

## How to install
There are two ways to add this extension:  
1. Visit the [extension page in Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/). _This is the recomended way_.
2. `git clone git@github.com:madebyaleks/Hextab.git`  
Then turn on developer mode in Chrome and load the folder. If you do it this way you'll need to update the extension manually.

## Haven't I seen this before..?
Probably. The entire project is based on [Jacopos](http://www.jacopocolo.com/) hexclock. There are also two or three extensions in the Web Store already. Neither of them can be customized though.
